# 🤖 HP Robotics

A ROS 2 simulation project featuring a **differential drive robot** in Gazebo, fully integrated with URDF, TF2, RViz, and Nav2 workflows. Designed for learning robot modeling, simulation, and autonomous navigation in a modular way.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🦾 Differential drive robot with realistic kinematics
- 📡 Real-time **TF2 transforms** for base and sensors
- 🖥️ Full **RViz2** visualization (robot, map, sensors)
- 🌍 **Gazebo Harmonic** simulation with physics and collisions
- 🔄 ROS-Gazebo communication via **`ros_gz_bridge`**
- 🧠 Navigation stack integration with AMCL and Nav2
- 🛠️ Modular **launch files** to start simulation, localization, and navigation
